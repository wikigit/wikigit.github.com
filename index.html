<p><b>wikigit</b> is a <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> organization (<a href="https://github.com/wikigit">organization page</a>) intended for hosting the source code of open source tools, scripts, and bots associated with <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/">other Wikimedia Foundation projects</a>. It has no official affiliation with the Wikimedia Foundation. Its goal is to ensure that source code of tools is available and that others can take over maintainence of tools if the original author becomes unavailable. It also makes it easy to create new bots based on old bots.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://wiki.toolserver.org/view/Main_Page">Toolserver</a>, it is easy to publish your tool on wikigit just by e-mailing an owner. If you want to contribute your tool or script, you have three options:

<ul>
<li><b>Link:</b> If your tool's source code is already hosted at another site, just e-mail a link to <a href="#owners">an owner</a>, and we'll include it on this page</li>
<li><b>We publish:</b> E-mail your current source code to <a href="#owners">an owner</a> and they will publish it for you. Include a license statement and any notes you want in a README file. Regular updates will be requested via e-mail and published.</li>
<li><b>You publish:</b> <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">Register an account at github.com</a> if you don't already have one. Then, <a href="#owners">e-mail an owner</a> with your username and the desired name for your project. We will set up an empty repository, give you full access to it, and send you back directions on how to push to it.</p>
</ul>

<p>In all cases your project will be added to the list on this page. Remember to remove references to private information like account passwords from your published code (place these in a separate file).</p>

<p>Services are provided entirely by <i>github</i>, except for the wikigit.org domain name and e-mail, which is provided by Derrick Coetzee.</p>
